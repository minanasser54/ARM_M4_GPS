# ARM Cortex-M4 GPS Interface

This project demonstrates interfacing a GPS module with an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. It utilizes the u-blox NEO-6M GPS module to receive GPS data and displays Distance on a LCD A1602 display.
and Draw the walked Trajectory using matplotlib
## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Keil µVision 5.
3. Compile the project and load it onto your Tiva C microcontroller.
4. Connect the u-blox NEO-6M GPS module to the microcontroller.
5. Connect the LCD A1602 display to the microcontroller.
6. Run the project and observe the distance on the display.
7. use retreiving Mode to view walked Trajectory
